                    My name is Bastab Mushahary, and I am 18 years old with a strong focus on web development and Discord moderation. Over the past few
                    years, I have worked on creating digital experiences while also contributing to online communities by managing servers and ensuring
                    positive engagement.

                    I began my journey at 15, quickly gaining hands-on experience in Discord moderation. With 2 3 years of experience, I have become skilled
                    in communication, conflict resolution, and fostering welcoming environments. Alongside this, I developed my interest in web development,
                    building a foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and creating clean, functional, and user-friendly websites.
